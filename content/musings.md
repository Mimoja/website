This is my not-blog, where I won't make blog posts but will occasionally post some musings.

## 3D Printing
I recently started 3D printing. It's a fun hobby.

I am using the Anet A8 printer based on the open-source [Prusa i3][prusa]. There is a
great community of Anet users who post helpful guides and models.

### Tips
1. The rods that fit in the z-axis motors seem too short for the frame. But you can raise the rod holders from the bottom so that the rods are flush the top of the frame
1. I recommend printing a few upgrades available on [Thingiverse][thingiverse].
    *  [Fan nozzle](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1620630): First thing I printed was V2 of this model.
    *  [Spool holder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1624641): I use the bolt and nut along with the original spool holder.
    *  [Extruder button](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1935151): Your fingers will thank you for this
    *  [Z endstop adjustment](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1776429): Makes it much easier to fine-tune the z-axis. I had to drill all the screw holes to fit the screws that came with the Anet kit.
